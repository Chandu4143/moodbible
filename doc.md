Mood Bible
Product summary

Mood Bible is a lightweight web app that helps people find Bible verses and short passages that respond to how they feel. Users type a mood (or pick from quick moods) and optionally share what they’re feeling in their own words. The app uses a verse-match engine to return comforting, encouraging, or clarifying Bible verses and short chapter excerpts tailored to the user’s mood and context.

Primary value: fast, empathetic scripture suggestions so users can feel heard and find relevant passages from the Bible without hunting through search results.

- Problem statement

Many people want scripture that speaks to their emotions (sad, anxious, thankful, guilty, lonely) but don’t know where to look or what translation fits best. Existing Bible apps show raw search results or entire chapters without context. Users need a compassionate, quick way to find passages that match their emotional state and small moments of need.
